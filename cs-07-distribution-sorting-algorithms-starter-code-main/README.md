## Distribution Sorts Exercise

### Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone This Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Complete the Exercise**

   - Open the `bucket-sort.js` file.
   - Implement the bucket sort algorithm by adding the necessary parameters and logic.

4. **Check Your Work**

   There is a test file for this exercise with the same name. Use this test file to check if your bucket sort algorithm is implemented correctly.
   To verify your solution, run the test file by executing:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Extra

We're only going to practice implementing bucket sort here because it's a slightly more common interview question and a more foundational algorithm. If you're curious to see what radix sort looks like in JavaScript, check it out a source [here](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sorting/radix-sort).
